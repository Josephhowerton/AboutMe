- 👋 Hi, I’m Joseph Howerton
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
I honestly really like working with code in my spare time but also keeping up with soccer. I am a proud Madrista and COYS. I also love the simplicity of making pasta. It reminds me a lot of programming in fact. Most software patterns whether it is architectural or design are extremely simple and beautiful but very hard to learn and so is pasta. Pasta at it's core is only two ingredients for every 100 grams of 00 flour add 1 egg (personally I also add an additional egg yolk). However, making great pasta is a life long journey similar to making great software.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
I am currently all in on Android Development. I am a CompSci student learning the "science of programming" in a traditional capacity, but I am teaching my self android development whenever I have free time.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
I want to collaborate with Machine Learning Engineers or Data Scientist in any capacity. Beyond Android, the idea of automating learning is fascinating and is something I want to be able to add to my apps in the fu
ture.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
Preferrably I would love to chat over the phone but I also accept text and emails.
